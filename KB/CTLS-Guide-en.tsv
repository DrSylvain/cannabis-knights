Weight loss due to drying should be recorded as ""Unfinished Inventory - Fresh Cannabis - Reduction - Drying/processing Loss"". The remaining quantity that is to be further processed as dried cannabis should be recorded as ""Unfinished Inventory - Fresh Cannabis - Reductions - Quantity Processed"" as well as ""Unfinished Inventory - Dried Cannabis - Additions - Production"". \n\n **There should always be an addition prior to a reduction - there should never be negative inventories.** "
